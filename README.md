👩‍💻 Add Me - Hands-on Activities and Code Snippets

Welcome to my repository! This space is dedicated to all the hands-on sessions, class practice, and bonus learning materials I’ve compiled. Here's a breakdown of what you'll find here and why it matters! 🚀

📁 Folders from Our Class Sessions:
These folders contain all the activities we did together in class. Each one is organized by date or session number to keep it neat and easy to follow:

📂 7-2-2025: The very first hands-on session we did! It includes introductory exercises that laid the foundation for our journey into NLP and vector representations.

📄 Handson Session-2: Even though it's a file, this one packs an entire session’s worth of hands-on exercises. Super helpful when reviewing specific class topics.

📂 Handson-3: This one includes more advanced examples as we progressed in class. Practical implementations helped reinforce the concepts we discussed.

📂 Handson-5: Freshly added! This folder contains our most recent class session, including additional notes and examples. 🆕

💡 These folders are based on in-class activities and reflect real-time learning with the instructor. Great for refreshing key concepts later!

📘 PDF Resource: The Vector Combo!
📄 nlp-vector final(both).pdf: This file is your go-to if you're looking to understand text file cosine similarity and PDF cosine similarity implementations.
It includes:

📌 Text-based vector cosine code 🧠

📌 PDF-based vector cosine code 📚

🧪 Practical use cases to test and understand the differences

🎯 Whether you're exploring NLP or just want to understand vector space models better, this file is a goldmine of examples and code!

💬 Why This Matters:
These resources represent the practical, hands-on side of NLP and vector mathematics — the stuff that helps you move from theory ➡️ to implementation. By keeping track of what we did in class and expanding on it, this repo becomes a personal notebook + toolkit for future projects and revision. 💼💡
